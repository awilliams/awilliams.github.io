This is a recipe for Spaghetti Squash Lasagna.

It can be prepared ahead of time and stored in the fridge until ready to bake.

### Spaghetti Squash

Cook **2** Spaghetti Squash.

I like to use the Instant Pot:
  1. Cut squash in half
  2. Place both halves in pot with 1 cup of water
  3. Cook on high pressure for 8 minutes
  4. Quick release

Separate and mix.

1. Once cooled a bit, remove the inside of the squash and place in a large mixing bowl
2. Add 1 or 2 eggs and mix
3. Optional: Add some olive oil, salt, other seasonings

### Sauce

Make a tomato sauce.

> Instead of canned sauce, consider using either
>   * 2 cans of diced tomatoes, or
>   * 1 can diced and 1 can tomato paste
>
> Add tomato to a pot and heat to reduce water.

1. Add sausage to sauce (roughly 4)
2. Add additional seasoning like basil, Italian seasoning, etc

### Layer

Layer squash, sauce, cheese into baking dish.

1. Add about 1/2 squash mix to the bottom of the dish. Use a fork to make a solid layer
2. Add sauce mix on top. Consider also adding things like:
    * Cheeses
    * Arugula
    * Vegetables
3. Add remaining squash mix on top
4. Top with things like shredded Parmesan, ricotta dollops, etc.

### Bake

1. Cover dish with foil
2. Bake for 50 minutes in the oven at **375 â„‰**
3. Remove foil and bake another 10 minutes, or until cheese becomes melted & brown
